# COMP-353
Database project
: The project consists of two parts: warm-up and main, described as follows:
a. The objective of part I, called the Warm-up, is to get acquainted with the MySQL
database management system (DBMS) to which you will be provided access. For
this project, we will provide a relational database design and your team is required
to (1) create the tables in MySQL, (2) populate them with "enough", typical data,
and (3) formulate and run a given set of queries against the database and report
the results.
b. In part II of the course project, called the main project, we will provide a description
of a "realistic" application for which your team should design a database schema.
You need to show details of the steps from the E/R diagram to the refined and
normalized relations. You also need to develop a suitable user interface to
facilitate expressing and executing queries and transactions against the MySQL
DBMS. This would be a two-tier application system using some standard browser
(e.g., Internet Explorer) at the client side. At the server side, the application uses
an http server with a PHP parser. The system is expected to support all
"representative" queries and transactions efficiently. Your final project report
should include descriptions of the database design, refined tables, the queries
formulated, and the results. This is a team project, for both parts. Each team
consists of four students. Each team member will be responsible for the entire
project and at least a well defined portion of the project, to be agreed by the team
members. The demos will be determined later around the end of the term. Each
team will have 20 minutes to demonstrate their working project developed. Your
project report must be submitted at your demo time. We will set a schedule to
book a time slot for your demo. Each team has a manager, chosen by the team
members, whose role is to coordinate the project-related activities of the team
members. After first lecture, each team manager should send an email to
stan@cse.concordia.ca with the following information about their team members:
Full names, student IDs, the ENCS EMAIL accounts, and a single team password
consisting of 8 alpha-numeric characters, with a CC to the course instructor.
Important Notes:
1. You are advised to retain a copy of all your term work until you receive your final grade for
the course. Please backup all your work on diskettes. All programs must have adequate
internal and external documentations. For the project, the hard copy of the report and a
copy on CD of the source code and the SQL scripts for loading the database must be
submitted at the demo time.
2. Students should be aware of the University's code of conduct (academic) as specified in
section 16.3.14 of the aforementioned calendar (page 65), especially the parts concerning
cheating, plagiarism, and possible consequence of violating this code. Sharing codes,
design diagrams, algorithms, etc. amongst teams or using from elsewhere (without proper
citation) is not permitted. No need to mention that you will learn little from copying others
work and, clearly, this will not help you prepare better in this course.
3. Submission format: All submissions in this course must be adequately bound and
include as the cover page, the "Expectations of Originality" form available from the course
web page.
4. Recommendation: We encourage a collaborative learning approach in this course. We
also recommend to start working on the projects and assignments as early as possible!
